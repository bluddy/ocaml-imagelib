(** Note: This module is an interface to the pure OCaml implementations of
   various image formats.

   For an easy to use file-based interface, see the [imagelib.unix] findlib
   package distributed with [imagelib].
   You find said interface in [src/imageLib_unix.mli] or in the
   documentation for the module {!ImageCodec_unix}.

   [ImageCodec_unix] will fall back to using [imagemagick's convert] utility
   to accomodate the manipulation of file formats that are not well supported
   by this library.

   The GIF implementation is still experimental;
   the [ImageCodec_unix] module reverts to [imagemagick] to avoid causing
   problems stemming from the premature state of the GIF stack.

(* [size fn] returns a couple [(w,h)] corresponding to the size of the image
   contained via the chunk_reader [ich].
   The exception [{!Corrupted_image} msg] is raised
   in case of problem.
   NB: This will try to run the command "convert" from imagemagick
   to convert to PNG if the file extension is unknown.

(** [size ~extension:ext ich] uses [ext] to select the image format.
    The leading dot is optional: [".png"] and ["png"] (in any case) are
    equivalent. *)

(* [openfile fn] reads the image in the file [fn]. This function guesses the
   image format using the extension, and raises [{!Corrupted_image} msg] in
   case of problem.

        resolution and defaults to [Four_four_four], i.e. no chroma
        subsampling.  Any alpha channel is ignored, and images whose
